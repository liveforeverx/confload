# Confload

OTP compliant configuration reloading for distillery. Distillery has build-in
`reload_config` command, which doesn't involved the application config and doens't
notify application about changed configuration.

This configuration reloader is OTP compliant and uses application callback for
configuration changes.

Additional feature to allow config live reloading (watching the configuration file and
automaticly reload configuration on change).

Per default it is disabled, set `watch: true` to enable it. You need to add `file_system`
to you dependencies. It is optional now.

Inspired by [exrm_reload](https://github.com/xerions/exrm_reload).
